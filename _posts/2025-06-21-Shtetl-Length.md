# 수고하세요!

수고하세요 ... what a wonderful phrase, it means work-hard, 화이팅 for the rest of your days!

A Han dynasty classic and casual farewell, the upper politeness register manifests as 

수고하셨어요, used as:

1. Cashier is a colleague ~ "great job working a full day today + goodbye"
2. Cashier has done great effort ~ "great effort!"

In that case, you (as the customer) could say 수고하셨습니다 as a way to say thanks (a gesture of gratitude).

So, working hard is as common as invoking Catholic Jesus in Latin culture? 

Why, yes! You're catching, on!

As his example shows, wittily demagoguing on science / life / politics / vagina teeth is a fantastic way to contribute to the ongoing dialectic, digitally, no doubt.

A healthily geeky persistence Puritan plowing is the key to happiness, in the land of milk and honey, in which such a right lays enshrined in its constitution.

Constituents of my blog, the purpose of this post was to scrutinize the shape and form of a shtetl (optimized blog).
