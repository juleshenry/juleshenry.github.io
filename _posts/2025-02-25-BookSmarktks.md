# What is education?

Is it the process by which woman learns the facts of this world, viz a viz a particular subdomain?

No, every caste defies global compatibility, few ye humans be police-doctor-plumber-scientist-poet-dancer.

Knowledge is so key to raising man's station; be it in markets, workforces, romantic relationships and war.

Twas' 2022 when my research led me to these papers:

2211.12781 (StrokeNet application of parsing Chinese characters via stroke romantization)
https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.12781

```sh
"This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No.62206076) and Shenzhen College Stability Support Plan (Grant No. GXWD20220811173340003 and GXWD20220817123150002)."
```
* I found it most curious to try to replicate the results of this paper, and I would love to do so in my free time.


KAN: Kolmogorov–Arnold Networks
https://arxiv.org/html/2404.19756v1

```sh
Figure 3.1:Compare KANs to MLPs on five toy examples. KANs can almost saturate the fastest scaling law predicted by our theory  (α = 4), while MLPs scales slowly and plateau quickly.
```
* I found it most curious to implement the KAN and try TOY examples
