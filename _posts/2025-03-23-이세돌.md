I have since childhood felt chess a useless skill to learn given its cracking by AI automata.
Why learn what at which a machine will always be superior?

And yet, now, to quote Bill Gates, intelligence is poised to become as common as water or electricity.

Perhaps, I overly invested my identity in my own natural talents of intellect.

Where do we go from here? 

Do we quit "life" as 이세돌 quit the game of *Go* upon learning he would never achieve leverage against AlphaGo?

We are at a cross-roads.

Will humanity smoke its turn 37 cigarette for the auto-annihilation by technofeudalist overlords?

Or, will we rise up on turn 78 with a divine play to defeat the incoming ai-pocalypse?

Time will only tell.
