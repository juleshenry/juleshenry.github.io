# Coca Cola, The Modern Soma
Mad Men dienemouant drives home the advertising business' coup d'etait, the manufactured desires' root muse oozing desire finds solitude in the capturing of the completeness of the transfiguration of the hippy movements' eye-opening chakras via the merchandising of said cultural-capitalist conjuring.

## Diet No Caffeine Gold Coke
The general rule about an algebra is the existence of the null element. And desire's econometric communiqu√©s are no different. Unorthodox as they come, the Coca-Cola company has even captured in an attempt for cash to sell desire itself. 

No longer selling the physical soma is enough. The soma's sedative, or should say, psychoactive stirring is now, for all intents, sat neutered, yet it still sells. The fact is, 1 + 0 is still a hair shy of zero, but it's "One", still!

## 20oz Diet Cream Soda
Drumming up models of various backgrounds with orange hair and red makeup solidifies the genius of the C-CC's marketing ideology.

Desire manifests soda as the (soda)-fication of a slew of of carrot-topped models. Thus, the consumer becomes desire re-selling itself. The human salient features vibe-transmute into flavor, reducing the subject to the object of their own desire, the ouroboros of marketing-client-desire collapses.

Vibe on.
