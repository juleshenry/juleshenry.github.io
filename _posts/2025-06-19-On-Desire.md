So, what if everything you ever loved was manufactured?

Your God, your identitarian spiritual ideology?

Your nation, your ersatz home by blood or birth.

Your family, your happenstance relatives?

As for your romantic partners, you're pre-programmed what's attractive, or do you rebel and doing so pursue a revolt against normalcy?

And the same is true for Coca-cola, do you really want one with your hamburger, or is it just what you're brain-washed into craving?

The devil don't make nothing better.

Fruta prohibida, lo dicen por las calles, porque somos de distintas sociedades.

¿Si bien o no me siguiese, que más da o diera?

Sultry forbidden ecstasty. Have you had it yet? 

What is your most shameful desire? What if your secret was out?

Salte del clóset, quítate el esmalte

Para que te vean, atrévete-te-te

Calle, calle, calle, callejero puro

Pa’l bailoteo con el flow más puro

¡Hello! Llegó el tipo

Que te quita el hipo

For you see, we surpassed all that introductory compulsory masturabtion, caught down to the apple core of that pull, that riptide of the heart.

# Introduction to Desire

Why do you do what you do? Zizek employs the Lacanian notion of desire as a lack, a void that can never be filled.
Lack, yes, ladies and gentlemen, is Lacanian - you, you are now witnessing the transposition of the mental, the internal opening a chasm in the neurosilical fabric of the technopsyche. 

Indeed, marxocapitalist analyses lend to capital position of the master signifier of the Oepidal other ether, symbolizing the retraction of the phallic id's ideal marriage of the same spacetime shakti of the binary's 1's surasha superego superposition pushing the anthropological principle's free will's collapsing on a zygote's zenith.

Man wants what he cannot have, and takes what he can get. 

You want a Coke, but the restuarant refuses to be exorted by the Coca-Cola corporation (CCC), so you barrel through into a Pepsi.

# On Desire

## Of the Buddha

Bốn sự thật (đế) bao gồm:

  - khổ đế (tiếng Pali: dukkha - sự không thỏa mãn, sự đau đớn, sự duy trì không bền vững) là một tính chất bẩm sinh tồn tại trong các cảnh luân hồi;

  - tập đế (tiếng Pali: samudaya - nguồn gốc, sự sanh khởi hay là "nguyên nhân"): Khổ (dukkha) khởi cùng với Ái (taṇhā). Trong khi Ái được dịch một cách truyền thống trong các ngôn ngữ phương tây là 'nguyên nhân' của Khổ, thì Ái còn có thể được xem là yếu tố buộc chúng ta vào Khổ, hoặc là một phản ứng đối với Khổ, cố gắng để thoát khỏi nó

  - diệt đế (tiếng Pali: nirodha - sự đoạn diệt, sự chấm dứt, sự giam cầm): Khổ có thể được chấm dứt hoặc được ngăn chặn bằng sự từ bỏ hoặc cắt đứt mối quan hệ với Ái; sự từ bỏ Ái sẽ giải thoát khỏi sự trói buộc của Khổ;
  
  - đạo đế (tiếng Pali: magga - con đường) bát chánh đạo là con đường dẫn đến sự từ bỏ, sự đoạn diệt Ái (tanha) và Thủ, và giải thoát khỏi Khổ (dukkha).

Four Truths (Noble) include:

  - Suffering Truth (Dukkha) (Pali: dukkha - dissatisfaction, pain, impermanence): is a characteristic inherent existing in realms cyclic (samsara).

  - Origin Truth (Samudaya) (Pali: samudaya - source, arising, or “cause”): Suffering (dukkha) arises together with Craving (taṇhā). While Craving is translated traditionally in languages Western as 'cause' of Suffering, then Craving also can be viewed as factor binding us to Suffering, or as a reaction to Suffering, trying to escape from it.

  - Cessation Truth (Nirodha) (Pali: nirodha - cessation, ending, restraint): Suffering can be ended or restrained by abandonment or cutting off connection with Craving; abandonment of Craving will liberate from bondage of Suffering.

  - Path Truth (Magga) (Pali: magga - path): Eightfold Noble Path is path leading to abandonment, cessation of Craving (taṇhā) and Attachment, and liberation from Suffering (dukkha).


## On Epicurus 
The avoidance of suffering is the highest bliss. 

No, no, no - i mean seriosuly, this is the iPhone of a Phione playing xylophione of a Manaphy's elephantitis.

 
## In Film

Why is it that Pepsi advertising appears in the Wall Street and Office Space movies as well as the Fast and Furious and the Sopranos series? The former pair have a diaometrically opposed view of capitalism. Wall Street lionizes Gordo Gekko, profet profiteer of greed yet resolves in its protagonist defying, then recognizing the truth of his father's blue collar virtues by enriching himself through fraud then eventually testifying against Gekko. Office Space approaches the critique through a hapless scammer who through sheer luck overcomes the moral bankrupcy of his attempt to scam thousands from the Initech corporation through a computer virus; nevertheless, he ends up literally blue collar working in construction but happy. The latter two ...

That Pepsi positions itself as pusher of these propagandas should come as no shock. Brilliantly, and in a sell-out's pluckiness kind of way, Pepsi Corp. recognizes the value of product placement.

That is why Zizek offers an interviewer a Coca-Cola from a two liter bottle in his fridge. He knows film is the medium by whcih his fame has propagated; capitalistically, he drinks of the fruits of his labor, in spite of his neomarxist stances.

# Desire's Ambition: Ambrosia 

## On Coca, Psychologically Manifested Physically


## Vin Mariani
Before Coca-Cola, there was Vin Mariani. 
Thomas Edison, the pope, and a whole bunch of Georgians walk into a bar...

Before Coca-Cola, there was Vin Mariani—a Bordeaux wine infused with coca leaves, the elixir of emperors and inventors. Picture this: 1863, Angelo Mariani, Corsican pharmacist, blends the "divine plant" of the Incas with fine French vintage. Seventeen milligrams of cocaine per ounce, marketed as a restorative for the weary elite. Thomas Edison swore by it, toiling through all-nighters with Vin-fueled vigor. Pope Leo XIII, that pontiff of progress, awarded it a Vatican gold medal and carried a flask etched with his likeness. Even Ulysses S. Grant, in his final days, sipped it to steady his pen for memoirs.

Before Coca-Cola, it was charcuterie for the veins—cured coca leaves, aged in oak, sliced thin with sophistication. Users reported euphoria, clarity, the didgeridoo's drone turned symphony. But whiplash? Inevitable. The crash followed the high, addiction the allure. By 1904, U.S. regulations curbed its cocaine kick, but the template was set: desire commodified, bottled bliss with a bitter aftertaste. Mariani's ambition? Ambrosia in a glass. Reality: a hook that reeled in the soul.

Coca-Cola, born in 1886 from John Pemberton's cocaine-laced syrup, a nod, or was it a trumpet's toot, to the Italian Peruvian stallion, shed its narcotic skin by 1903 but its premise lived on, refreshment's Bob Marley redemption song, the somber soma of the United States' capitalist perfectioning empire.

# Coca Cola, The Modern Soma

Mad Men's denouement drives home the advertising business' coup d'etait, the manufactured desires' root muse oozing desire finds solitude in the capturing of the completeness of the transfiguration of the hippy movements' eye-opening chakras via the merchandising of said cultural-capitalist conjuring.

It's not a drink but the idea of imbibing that transcends a concept's innuendo — "hilltop" - a multicultural chorus crooning unity in defanged fructose cavity brew.

Desire dreams of ambrosia—the gods' nectar, immortality in a sip. But history serves up mortal proxies: elixirs that promise transcendence, only to deliver the whiplash of crash and craving. From papal tonics to ad-agency soma, we've bottled our lacks, labeled them luxuries, and guzzled down the illusion.

## Diet No Caffeine Gold Coke
The general rule about an algebra is the existence of the null element. And desire's econometric communiqués are no different. Unorthodox as they come, the Coca-Cola company has even cashed in on capturing desire distillate. 

No longer selling the physical soma is enough. The soma's sedative, or should say, psychoactive stirring is now, for all intents, sat neutered, yet it still sells. The fact is, 1 + 0 is still a hair shy of zero, but it's "One", still!

Bubbles burst into fleeting aspirations, amor-fati of satiation. 

## 20oz Diet Cream Soda
Drumming up models of various backgrounds with orange hair and red makeup solidifies the genius of the CCC's marketing ideology.

Desire manifests soda as the (soda)-fication of a slew of of carrot-topped models. Thus, the consumer becomes desire re-selling itself. The human salient features vibe-transmute into flavor, reducing the subject to the object of their own desire, the ouroboros of simulacrum-consumer-producer collapses.

So when you pry open the gas station 'fridge of dreams', and grab that 20oz Diet Cream Soda, fancy yourself couple isotopes away from a pope's pinnacle of pleasure and put that in your pipe and smoke it, only to find the ash a secret ingredient of the formula.

Yet, did not Jesus turn water upon wine, did he not, or did you confuse the same analogy of the free market of vin mariani into a modern Bolivian's syncretic Catholic birthing ceremony to beseech La Sante Muerte? 

My God, pass me a fucking Marlboro already.
