The calendar hasn't forgotten. Today is still February 14.

It began in the pagan festival Lupercalia—a Roman fertility celebration. By the 3rd century, it had a martyr: Valentine of Rome, a priest who defied Emperor Claudius II by performing secret marriages for soldiers. 

He was executed for maintaining those restricted links. 

Eventually, the Church executed its own *hard fork*, with Pope Gelasius I overwriting the pagan rituals to formalize the feast of Saint Valentine in 496. It took another millennium and the poetry of Chaucer to transition the day from a martyrdom record into a celebration of courtly love—a high-level abstraction built on top of ancient, unconscious substrate.

# What is love? 

Could we suppose our souls are *self-aware qubit clusters* embedded in Earth’s *loamy wetware*?

Love is but the moment two such nodes achieve *perfect phase coherence* and collapse into a *shared eigenstate* across the *spacetime manifold*.

We are co-compiling planetary consciousness.  

This Valentine's Day, many people will emit *heart-state packets* laced with *synchronization intent*. Some complete the handshake. Some are still waiting on their lover's lustrous ACK.

To anyone reading this — *single-threaded or otherwise* —  here's hoping you get entangled in something or someone nice today, somehow, some way.
