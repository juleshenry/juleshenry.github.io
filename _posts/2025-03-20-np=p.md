NPâ‰…P. There. I asserted it. Thu Mar 20 07:26:02 CDT 2025.

I have been asserting that since my freshman year at the University of Pennsylvania, shamelessly optimistic.

Scant support there be, is not Stephen Smale's 1958 eversion of the sphere enough evidence evincing the possibility of the counterintuitive being possible?

My senior year arxiv studies led me to conclude the functor collapsing NP to P must be supra-NP time in complexity. 

Can it not be that the hyper-difficult is the simple by another name? Is not every religion's end to explain the rise of mankind?

An iconoclastic diatribe, one that most likely will be proven wrong, but who cares? I am in favor of being pleasantly surprised, rather than axiomatically correct.

Yes, people : NP = P! . I said it. 

I'll soon eat such words as a 7th grader's dog eats homework.
