"O members of parliaments throughout the world! Select ye a single language for the use of all on earth, and adopt ye likewise a common script. God, verily, maketh plain for you that which shall profit you and enable you to be independent of others. He, of a truth, is the Most Bountiful, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. This will be the cause of unity, could ye but comprehend it, and the greatest instrument for promoting harmony and civilization, would that ye might understand!"
```
- Kit√°b-i-Aqdas 189

For centuries, bright-eyed idealists have enthused in the creation of a universal one world language, the most famous of which is Esperanto. What becomes clear across these unifying projects is that breaking our tribalistic tendencies by transcending terrain entails a wild dance of a democracy of ideas. There are two elements for the constructed universal language that determine its flavor: morphemes and syntax. In the former case, the language draws source material from existing spoken languages; in the latter, rules are set up governing relationships between said meaning-packets.

A spectrum exists amongst constructed languages. There is the "naturalistic" variety, staying loyal to the vocabulary, grammar, and other characteristics of from natural languages and the "schematic" sort, that which is fabricated from ideals set about by the conn-lang's creator(s). 

In Europe, *Esperanto* beget an off-spring by reformers seeking to simplify the movement, namely, *Ido*; next, a gentleman involved in Ido gave rise to *Novial*, a genderless SVO parlance in which verbs conjugate without agreement according to plurality, now dormant.

 Also a former Esperantist, Edgar de Wahl developed *Occidental*, a naturalistic interlanguage under the motto "that international language is best which in every point offers the greatest facility to the greatest number" - later picked up and rebranded *Interlingue* by the Soviet Union in part to adjoin the nascent *Interlingua*, the American International Auxiliary Language Association's systematic approach that prioritized immediate comprehensibility. 
 
 Finally, we would be remiss to forget mathmetician Giuseppe Peano's simplification of Latin, *Latino sine flexione*, a sort of modern Latin Vulgare, the kind of which we will set out to construct in the following project.
