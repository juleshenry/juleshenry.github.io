## Review

We must amelioriate yesteryear. Financial education is neither art nor a science; it is a practice. Typical knowledge or maids' wisdom applies not. Game theoretically, the most popular strategy cannot always be dominant.

The Richest Man in Babylon is not that one who is wealthiest, rather, the one who navigates its customs and aphorisms with knowledge of the urgency to innovate by rebellion, excel by heterodox and recognition of a higher state of affairs, namely, Zion.
